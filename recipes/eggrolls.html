		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>A basic Chinese takeout style eggroll made with cabbage and pork filling. Makes roughly 2 dozen.
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 cups shredded savoy cabbage</li>
			<li>8 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded carrots</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded celery</li>
			<li>3 chopped scallions</li>
			<li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
			<li>3 cups shredded or diced roast pork</li>
			<li>2 cups chopped cooked shrimp (optional)</li>
			<li>1 package eggroll wrappers</li>
			<li>1 beaten egg</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Put the cabbage, carrots, and celery into the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes. Transfer the veggies to an ice bath and drain. Thoroughly squeeze out all the excess water from the vegetables (you can put the drained veggies in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out the water). This is a very important step because if the filling is too wet, you will have a wet filling and soggy egg rolls!</li>
			<li>Once dry, transfer the veggies to a large mixing bowl. Add the scallions, salt, sugar, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons oil, five spice powder (if using), white pepper, roast pork, and cooked shrimp (if using). Toss everything together. The filling is ready to be wrapped!</li>
			<li>To wrap the egg rolls, take a small fistful of filling, squeeze it a little in your hand until it is compressed together, and place it on the wrapper. The wrapping method is similar to that of a burrito. Just add a thin layer of egg to make sure it stays sealed. Line them up on a lightly floured surface, and continue assembling until you run out of ingredients.</li>
			<li>In a small pot, heat oil to 325 degrees. You don't need too muchâ€”just enough to submerge the egg rolls. Carefully place a couple egg rolls into the oil, and fry them for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil to make sure they fry evenly.</li>
			<li>Cool slightly and serve! Freeze leftovers in freezer bags and reheat them in the oven at 350 degrees, until crispy.</li>
