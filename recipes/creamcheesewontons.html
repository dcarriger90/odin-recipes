		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Also commonly called crab rangoon when imitation crab is added to filling. Essentially crispy, fried dumplings filled with cream cheese and onion normally found in American Chinese takeouts. Makes about 3 dozen wontons.
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3>For the Wontons:</h3>
			<li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>4 scallions</li>
			<li>1 pack wanton wrappers</li>
			<li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
			<h3>For the Dipping Sauce:</h3>
			<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon siracha (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the wonton filling by combining the cream cheese, sugar, salt, and scallions.</li>
			<li>Assemble the wontons. Take each wrapper, and dampen the outer edges with a thin layer of water. Place a teaspoon of the cream cheese filling in the middle, and fold in half into a triangle. Bring the two corners on the long side of the triangle together, and seal with another dab of water. Continue until all the wontons are assembled.</li>
			<li>Heat a couple inches of vegetable oil in a small pot until it reaches 375 degrees F. Fry the wontons in batches––about 2 minutes per batch––until golden brown. Definitely use a small pot for this and fry in multiple batches; you’ll use much less oil!</li>
			<li>Make the dipping sauce by combining all the sauce ingredients, and serve with the wontons.</li>
		</ol>
